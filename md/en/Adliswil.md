## Experiential report as a pedestrian

*This segment contains personal opinions and dangerous superficial knowledge. All statements in this segment should be taken with a pinch of salt because it is very much possible that it contains errors. My source for this segment are just 2 visits on the municipal territory that I made as a pedestrian.*

There are quite a lot of sidewalks but not a lot of explicit cycle lanes. However the sidewalks are often intended to be used by both pedestrians and cyclists. There are some smaller streets without a sidewalk, but it is usually not a problem to walk or cycle on those streets.
