## Experiential report as a pedestrian

*This segment contains personal opinions and dangerous superficial knowledge. All statements in this segment should be taken with a pinch of salt because it is very much possible that it contains errors. My source for this segment are just 2 visits on the municipal territory that I made as a pedestrian.*

It seems like there are only very few sidewalks and bike lanes on the municipal territory. The only place where I saw a sidewalk next to the street was on the short segment of th Thurtalstrasse, that is located on the municipal territory.  
On the other hand there are a lot of field and/or forest paths that are used by very few or cars at all and are primarily or only used by pedestrians and cyclists. These field and forest paths seem to be in a good condition.

The bicycle seems to be quite popula in the region.
