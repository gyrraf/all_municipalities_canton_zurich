## Experiential report as a pedestrian

*This segment contains personal opinions and dangerous superficial knowledge. All statements in this segment should be taken with a pinch of salt because it is very much possible that it contains errors. My source for this segment are just 1 visit on the municipal territory that I made as a pedestrian.*

The amount of sidewalks on the municipal territory is acceptable.  
The Reppischtalstrasse, that leads through the Aeugstertal, has a combined foot and cycling path on the entire length. The Mülibergstrasse, that leads from Aeugstertal through Müliberg to Affoltern a. A., only has a foot or cycling path inside the hamlets. However there is a path from Müliberg to Aeugstertal for pedestrians that is actually even shorter than the road. The Sonnenbergstrasse, that connects Müliberg with Aeugst, also only has a foot or cycle path inside the villages. However there is an alternative for pedestrians and cyclists here as well that is approximately the same length as the road but is used by significantly fewer cars. The Aeugsterstrasse/Affolternstrasse/Dorfstrasse, that connects Affoltern a. A. through Aeugst to the Albisstrasse, also only has a foot or cycle path in the village. In this case however there is no obvious alternative for pedestrians and cyclists. And also the Jonentalstrasse, that leads from Affoltern a. A. through the Jonental to the Albisstrasse and Rifferswil, has no foot or cycle path. There is a forest/field path further up and/or further down, these are however not as short as the Jonentalstrasse. Probably the best alternative here is the Wängibadstrasse, that also doesn't have a foot or cycle path, but at least isn't used by cars as much.  
Most of the other streets also don't have a foot or cycle paths, but at least pedestrians and cyclists can use the streets pretty well because the car traffic is rare and slow enough.

On the entirity of the municipal territory there are quite a lot of field and forest paths that are in a good condition. There are also several benches, a bunch of water wells and a few fireplaces (mainly close to the Türlersee).

The view in the village Aeugst is amazing. In good weather one can see the Wildspitz, the Rigi (both Kulm and Hochflue), the Pilatus (or at least I assume this) and more inner swiss mountains. In the south-eastern part of the village one can also see the city Zug and the Zugersee.  
The peak of the Aeugsterberg is pretty much unmarked and there is no view from there (which isn't necessarily something bad).
